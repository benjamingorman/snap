1) SNAP!

We would like you to write a program to simulate a game of SNAP in Python using the standard libraries as much as possible. The problem is deliberately not too complex - what we are looking at is how you approach the problem, structure of your code etc.

How to play Snap (Background Information):
* Snap! is a card game where all of the cards are shuffled and dealt equally to players (a group of 2, 3 or 4 people).
* Each player in turn turns over the top card from their face down dealt pile and puts it on top of their face up pile.
* When someone turns over a card that matches the value (same number, or same face) of a card on top of another player's face up pile, the players race to be the first to say “Snap!”
* The player who says “Snap!” first wins both piles and adds them to their winning pile.
* If more than one player says “Snap!” at the same time, the two piles are combined into the snap pot.
* Whoever wins the next snap wins the whole pot.
* At the end of the game, when all players have dealt their original hand of cards. The player with the most cards wins the game.

Requirements
* The task is to simulate a game of snap between two players using standard playing card decks.
* The application should ask the user how many playing card decks to play with
* The application should shuffle the decks before play commences
* Games of snap should now be simulated. Cards are played one at a time and when two matching cards are dealt one after another the first player to shout snap wins. (You do not need to implement the case of a draw round)
* The winner of each round collects all the cards dealt in this round
* Once all cards in the deck are exhausted the application should declare the winner based on who has the most won cards

How to complete this task:
* Simplicity is key, there is no need to implement features that have not been explicitly requested here.
* Any data stores should run in-memory for the sake of this task
* Use whatever frameworks/libraries you like or feel comfortable with. But do not forget about point 1!
* The final result should run in a standard environment which should include instructions to run it if necessary.
* You can simply print all outputs to the terminal/console
* Share your code/program with me to take a look and run it! (GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket link, or a zip of the file(s) including .git)
